**Evapotranspiration (ET) models for use in python and with integration into Google Earth Engine.**

geeet aims to provide users with ready-to-use evapotranspiration (ET) models, both for numerical values and for use with Google Earth Engine. 

This initial release features a PT-JPL model adapted for arid environments (as described in Aragon et al., 2018). A notebook example is included in `./examples/notebooks/01_PTJPL.ipynb`.
